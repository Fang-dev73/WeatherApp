Created a Weather App using Kotlin, JSON and XML.

This app can be used to know:
The weather details
Current Temperature
Wind flow rate and 
The sunrise and sunset time of the day according to the geo-location given by the user.

Also it contains a decent User Interface with soothing color combination.
